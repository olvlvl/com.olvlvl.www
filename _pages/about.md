Olivier works at [HelloFresh][] as tech-daddy for recipes and menus. Passionate about system
architecture, he also takes care of the API that is serving mobile and web applications,
refactoring bits here and there, making sure it sparkles.

Olivier is a veteran software craftman, with more than 25 years of experience in software design,
development, and architecture. Self thought, he started programming at 14, copying lines after lines
of BASIC on his cousin's 6128. At age 16 he bought an Amiga 1200, that changed his life forever. He
created [LotanLibs][] to extend BasicBlitz2; and [Feelin][] to create and maintain applications and
their UI with XML and CSS. Building Feelin's website he discovered PHP and a brand new world to
explore.

Since then he created [ICanBoogie][], a super fast micro-framework; [Brickrouge][] a collection of
libraries to create and animate HTML elements; [IDependOnYou][], a super tiny AMD implementation;
[Icybee][], a buzzing CMS; and a bunch of little thingsâ€¦ As a firm open-source believer, he also
contributed to multiple projects such as [MooTools][], [Bootstrap][], [MacDown][], [gfm_viewer][],
[html5please][], [ApiGen][], and [Composer][].

You can find Olivier on [GitHub][] and [Twitter][].
