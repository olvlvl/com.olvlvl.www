# 1 ms, 5 ms

Developing [ICanBoogie][], I always tried my best to make it fast despite adding nicer and nicer
features. I had very nice timings with PHP 5.6 but now with [PHP 7][] it's on another level. For
instance, on this shared host (around 4€/month) it takes [ICanBoogie][] 1ms to boot and 5 ms to
return a response for the home page; that is routing, checking for new/updated articles, fetching
records, rendering… and all that stuff. Basically, it's 3 times faster than PHP 5.6.

You can check it out for yourself in the source code of the page, with a comment at the bottom
similar to this one:

```html
<!-- booted in: 1.223 ms, completed in 4.705 ms -->
```

On the `ping` endpoint (<http://olvlvl.com/api/ping?timer>), which is basically the route used to
test the overhead of the framework, I get timings similar to this:

```
pong, in 1.818 ms (ready in 1.214 ms)
```





## PHP 7 and all that jazz

Speed improvements aside, [PHP 7][] has so many great features I can't wait to implement:

- [Anonymous classes](http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.anonymous.php), how sexy is that!?
- [Return type declarations](http://php.net/manual/en/functions.returning-values.php#functions.returning-values.type-declaration)
- [Type declarations](http://php.net/manual/en/functions.arguments.php#functions.arguments.type-declaration) improvements
- [Expectations](http://php.net/manual/en/function.assert.php#function.assert.expectations)
- And of course the engine throwing exceptions instead of dying with fatal errors <3 (Also [Throwable](http://php.net/manual/en/class.throwable.php) <3)





## tl;dr

[ICanBoogie][] is pretty fast, with PHP 7 it's faster.
