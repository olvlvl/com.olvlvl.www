# A new hope

It started as an exercise to try out the features implemented in [ICanBoogie][] v3.0, without the
comfort of [Icybee][]. Something that would allow me to discover areas of improvement by trying
different approaches and test limits.

The blog is built on the _controller/model/view/render_ foundation. Articles are available as
[Markdown][] files. They are converted into records and stored in a SQLite database. A hash is used
to check if an article has been updated. The date and slug of the article come from its filename;
its title is extracted form the [Markdown][] file rendered using [Parsedown][]. View templates are
classic PHP files. Statistics are appended to the rendered HTML and include [ICanBoogie][] boot time
as well as the complete time. [Highlight.js][] is used to highlight code examples and Bootstrap
v4-alpha (living on the edge!) is used for styleâ€¦ albeit there's not much to style.

The code is available on GitHub: <https://github.com/olvlvl/com.olvlvl.www>

I already have a blog in French ([weirdog.com][]), hopefully this new beginning in English
will encourage me to share my experiences more regularly. It's not the new year yet, but it's my
resolution, and I hope you'll enjoy reading it.
